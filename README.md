# Lending Library Reminder for Dancing Bear Toys

This script automates a free toy library for teachers at Dancing Bear Toys. It's bound to a Google Form response sheet. When teachers check out a toy, they fill out the form with their name, email address, and toy on loan. The Google sheet automatically calculates their due date based on today's date.

This script sends several reminder emails to the teachers leading up to and immediately after their due date. It also alerts the Dancing Bear Staff if a toy is one week overdue. 

When a toy is returned, a staff member enters the letter 'y' in the 'Returned?' column and the script will halt all emails.

A copy of the google sheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WR6Mfh0ubLrF0xHMIHNPdC9471VNm6wnnQz1INSZMRk/edit?usp=sharing) for reference.
